Step 1 Verifying Files
Add file verification to user.sh. The user.txt file stores the user name and password. If
the user.txt file does not exist, the system prompts you to enter the user name and
password and saves them to a user.txt file.
#!/bin/bash
while :
do
 if test -e user.txt
 then
 echo "Entering the Login Program:"
 break
 else
 echo "The user does not exist. Enter the user registration program."
 echo "Please enter username for storage:"
 read username
 echo "Please enter password for storage:"
 read password
 fi
done
username_file="root"
password_file="123456"

Step 2 Check the user name and password based on multiple conditions.
Add the user name and password judgment.
#!/bin/bash
while :
do
 if test -e user.txt
 then
 echo "Entering the Login Program:"
 break
 else
 echo "The user does not exist. Enter the user registration program."
 echo "Please enter username for storage:"
 read username
 echo "Please enter password for storage:"
 read password
 if test -n $username -a -n $password
 then
 echo "$username $password" > user.txt
echo "Storage Successed!"
echo ""
break
 else
 echo "Please enter a non empty username or password:"
continue
 fi
 fi
done
