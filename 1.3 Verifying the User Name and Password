Step 1 Save the user name and password.
Save the data in the user.txt file to the user name and password variables for
subsequent user name and password verification.
username_file=`awk 'NR==1{print $1}' user.txt`
password_file=`awk 'NR==1{print $2}' user.txt`



Step 2 Verify the result.
Save and exit the vim insert mode. Enter an empty user name and password, an incorrect
user name and password, and a correct user name and password. The following shows
an example:
[root@openEuler ~]# sh user.sh
The user does not exist. Enter the user registration program.
